### Project Title
Data analysis for bike sharing in Chicago, Washington, and New York City

### Description
This project allows the user to access bikeshare data from three cities - Washington, New York City, and Chicago.  It includes information such as the start and end of each trip, the stations the bikes were rented from and returned to, and information about the bike renters (gender and birth year).  The program allows the user to filter the data based on city and month, and provides the user with analyzed information.  It also gives the user the opportunity to see the raw filtered data 5 rows at a time.
